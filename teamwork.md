## Use of agile practices

Initially, work was split preferentially, in sections involving message, user, 
channel and auth functions, to minimise the amount of work that was forced 
onto people, and group members happily picked sections that they wished to do. 
From here, we steadily did our individual work until we eventually hit functions
that required collaboration and consensus between different people. 

At this stage, we could resolve most issues over messaging, as they were fairly 
minor, but we decided to meet up 2 times in week 6 to resolve issues. When we 
scheduled meetings with a certain agenda already in mind, we found that it was 
much more productive than simply meeting up to code our respective sections
on our own, which was what we expected to do.

Meeting 1
Date: 1/11/19
Participants: Lucasz, George

Meeting 2
Date: 8/11/19
Participants: Bob, George, Lucasz, Steven

Meeting 3
Date: 15/11/19
Participants: Bob, George, Lucasz, Steven

Meeting 4
Date: 3/11/19
Participants: Bob, George, Lucasz, Steven

Meeting 5
Date: 10/11/19
Participants: Bob, George, Lucasz, Steven

Every meeting, we would start by trying to resolve whatever large issues were 
brought up in the past few days. 



There were several issues, thankfully none of them were too major. It was mostly
stemming from sections of different members' code that did not comply with each
other, for example, a class written in .global did not agree with someone else's
understanding of that class, requiring us to clarify things with each other over
messaging and in meetings. Whenever there was a problem, things would be sorted 
quite quickly as we were happy to take responsibility for things in order to 
achieve a final result.

Despite having initially planned on separating the code responsibilities so that
the only concerns were structure and formatting, aiming to minimise the number of
people working on the same file to reduce merge conflicts, the same code was 
required by multiple people at some point. This was towards the end of the iteration
and it was found that in the leadup to sunday deadline, the 2 members had 
firstly worked out between them which sections they would look after and
secondly they found that their schedules did not leave much room for them to
work at the same time, eliminating most of our concerns.

To figure out the team's workload and capacity, we need to put together a list of
tasks that each group member is responsible for, determine the scope and time needed 
in order to complete each task (and the worst case scenario : if each group member 
hasn't finished their task(s) and our work intersects with each other, we plan on 
meeting each other to help complete the unfinished tasks one by one.  
We will prioritize work based on importance and weighting, based on the marking criteria.  
Therefore, we assign out the highest priority work first.  We will allocate our
group members into their specialized fields because we can only manage what we know. 
We hope to meet each other as much as we can so that we can check in with the 
progress of our project and adjust our workloads if needed.  Situations where we
cannot meet each other, we check in through messenger, or discord, or email.  
Each task set to each group member may overlap because we may do the same thing. 
However, that may not be a bad thing because even though we lose time doing exactly 
the same task, we can compare each other's work and pick the most efficient way.


For iteration3, we held an initial group meeting during week the end of week6. 
From there we discussed our approach to iteration 3 and decided that group members 
would continue working on testing and iterating their functions with the front end 
react app. This this because members were more familiar with their functions and had
more expertise in their functions. From there we held, regular group discussions on 
Facebook's messenger - for example members where unfamiliar with starting the react 
app and knowing which packages needed to be pip installed. This also allowed our 
members to bounce ideas off each other, for example messages functions are very
dependent on the channel functions requiring more collaboration between our members 
and problem solve as a team. Furthermore, we help weekly group meeting in lab and 
outside the classroom in weeks 7 and 8 - so members could update the group and hold 
any discussions on the project. This also allowed us to be informed of the each individualâ€™s 
progress with their work and consequently allowed us to work with more synergy 
and collaboratively in iteration3.
